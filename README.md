# Music-Box
This project is to implement a application called MusicBox, that is a “DIGITAL JUKEBOX” As it is known, the traditional jukebox has disappeared from the market. There are many reasons for this,such as the limitation of storage capacity and the update frequency of music is not timely. This project proposes to apply the digital technology to build a new JUKEBOX system.  The flexibility for customers here will be able to pick songs from a list of songs that are displayed as well as they are able to view it. The main purpose is to help change the traditional playlist into a more revolutionary playlist using Data Structure, that is implemented using C++ Programming Language.
